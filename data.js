the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.", "146": "These challenges are not all of government's making.", "894": "And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.", "31": "The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.", "430": "Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance.", "310": "Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.", "57": "The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.", "58": "They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.", "570": "Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.", "825": "In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.", "446": "The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.", "715": "Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?", "736": "The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?", "611": "So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.", "614": "Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.", "745": "When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?", "622": "An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.", "755": "Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.", "135": "To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.", "649": "making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.", "782": "But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.", "790": "Make no mistake ?", "164": "The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.", "308": "You make a big election about small things.", "693": "Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier.", "66": "We'll have to make hard choices.", "339": "It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.", "590": "It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.", "347": "\"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.", "613": "And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.", "246": "And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.", "3": "In the face of war, you believe there can be peace.",

and still have to sit at the back of a bus.", "779": "This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.", "542": "But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.", "799": "that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.", "674": "This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.", "810": "The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.", "699": "And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.", "701": "For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.", "720": "And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.", "722": "Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.", "727":

he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.", "884": "Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.", "643": "We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.", "428": "Enough of the broken promises.", "208": "And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.", "209": "What is that promise?", "338": "That promise is our greatest inheritance.", "217": "That's the promise we need to keep.", "602": "This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.", "133": "To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;\nWith profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.", "391": "And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.", "397": "She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation.", "276": "As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.", "536": "In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.", "792": "It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening.", "544": "In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea.", "34": "In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.", "168": "A nation of whiners?", "552": "Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.", "554": "Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.", "557": "When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.", "815": "and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.", "560": "As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.", "567": "It cannot wait for other nations to act first.", "568": "The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.", "711": "money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.", "459": "Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.", "127": "Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.", "896": "We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.", "264": "That's not the judgment we need.", "266": "We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.", "270": "If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.", "24": "That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.", "924": "We need to see more.", "160": "And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.", "294": "The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.", "831": "And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.", "325": "I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.", "218": "That's the change we need right now.", "739": "Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must.", "868": "And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.", "870": "And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?", "881": "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", "499": "I did not need sewing either.", "503": "I don't need to sew to go to college.", "280": "I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.", "413": "The world has changed.", "322": "Change comes to Washington.", "713": "and that strategy must change.", "116":

that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.", "333": "I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.", "89": "We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.", "222": "I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.", "612": "Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.", "234": "And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.", "628": "As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where
